# THE ROLE OF TELENCEPHALON SIZE IN COGNITION IN THE GUPPY _(Poecilia reticulata)_

Data analysis of my Master thesis project, done at Stockholm University  during Autumn 2019 - Autumn 2020. 
Statistical analyses of five different cognitive test: 
 - problem-solving
 - reversal learning
 - spatial learning 
 - short-term memory
 - long-term memory 

All analyses were performed with software R (v.3.6.1)

## ABSTRACT

The dramatic expansion of telencephalon in large-brained species has caused great attention as the neural substrate of cognitive evolution. Previously, lesion studies have linked the telencephalon with highly demanding behaviours, and comparative studies have associated telencephalon size or telencephalon structures with cognitive abilities. While there is a great number of studies using comparative and lesion approaches examining this matter, both practices have limitations. Thus, here I used artificially selected female guppies for relative telencephalon size to experimentally test the evolutionary effect of telencephalon size on cognition. The females were tested for three different experiments, problem-solving in a detour-task, colour-cued reversal learning and spatial learning. The effect of relative telencephalon size was only detected for problem-solving and spatial learning, suggesting a lesser involvement of the telencephalon in cued reversal learning tasks. Unexpectedly, fish with smaller telencephalon out-performed fish with larger telencephalon for all the significant differences found. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. This study implies a more complex relationship between telencephalon size variation and cognitive abilities than previously suggested. Future experiments should focus on fine-scale structural differences with holistic approaches of the brain to fully understand the differences in cognitive abilities between the telencephalon selection lines.
